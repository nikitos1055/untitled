    <p>Mercedes-Benz origins' come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz
        Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
        automobile.
        The fuel was not gasoline, it was a much more volatile petroleum spirit with several names including
        ligrane/ligrain/ligroin. This was used as a degreaser, spot remover, paint thinner, etc. and was so quick to
        burn or
        explode, it was not stored inside. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</p>
